# UDP_socket_programming
Lab I did in Uni for operating systems, which demonstrates datagram sockets in Java and shows the basic structure of servers and clients. The purpose of this project was like a warmup where I was reminding myself of Java and managing projects in Intellij because I was using other scripting languages for a while. Additionally, this lab also helped me understand operating systems socket programming, and application layers.
